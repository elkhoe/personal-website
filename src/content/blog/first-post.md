As a producer and music junkie,I’ve been paying a lot more attention to how I listen, not just what I listen to—especially which platforms soak up most of my time. A quick at my phone's most recently used apps: Spotify is right at the top of the stack followed by Soundcloud, Bandcamp, and Apple Music. 

I love Spotify. The UI, the integration of devices, and its vast library of music — there's a reason why Spotify is the most popular streaming service. But with conformity usually comes homogeneity. And with homogeneity comes lack of individuality. You know those mood playlists or daylists that you wonder how well they just know your tastes? Well Spotify's algorithms ruthlessly shut outs smaller artists in those discovery playlists and instead props up artists essentially to the highest bidder. There's a reason why you see Sabrina Carpenter on every playlist. It's all about generating revenue. And the sad part about it all is very few people care! As long as they get to listen to their greatest "hits" and are able to find some hidden gems, no one will protest. 

What incentive does Spotify and other music platforms have to change their business model if users are satisfied with that kind of service? I mean who would want to get rid of Spotify Wrapped? I'm a sucker for those stats (even though it's not indicative of my music tastes whatsoever. Ignore the one off Bieber song). 

I've been leaning harder on Bandcamp, radios, and sets to discover new sounds. Yes, it's more tedious but it's a small price to pay to find actual good music and more importantly, support lesser known artists. Who knows, maybe it's futile, but it's the only way fight back.
